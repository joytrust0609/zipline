class BarData:
    """
    Provides methods for accessing minutely and daily price/volume data from
    Algorithm API functions.

    Also provides utility methods to determine if an asset is alive, and if it
    has recent trade data.

    An instance of this object is passed as ``data`` to
    :func:`~zipline.api.handle_data` and
    :func:`~zipline.api.before_trading_start`.

    Methods:

    current(assets, field)
        Returns the "current" value of the given fields for the given assets
        at the current simulation time.

    history(assets, fields, bar_count, frequency)
        Returns a trailing window of length ``bar_count`` containing data for
        the given assets, fields, and frequency.

    can_trade(assets)
        Returns True if the asset is alive, the exchange is open, and there is a
        known last prices.

    is_stale(assets)
        Returns True if the asset is alive but the last price is stale.

    current_chain(continuous_future)
        Returns the current futures chain as of the simulation date.

    See the individual methods for more details.

        Returns the "current" value of the given fields for the given assets

        Parameters
        ----------
        assets : zipline.assets.Asset or iterable of zipline.assets.Asset
            The asset(s) for which data is requested.
        fields : str or iterable[str].
            Requested data field(s). Valid field names are: "price",
            "last_traded", "open", "high", "low", "close", and "volume".

        Returns
        -------
        current_value : Scalar, pandas Series, or pandas DataFrame.
            See notes below.

        Notes
        -----
        The return type of this function depends on the types of its inputs:

        - If a single asset and a single field are requested, the returned
          value is a scalar (either a float or a ``pd.Timestamp`` depending on
          the field).

        - If a single asset and a list of fields are requested, the returned
          value is a :class:`pd.Series` whose indices are the requested fields.

        - If a list of assets and a single field are requested, the returned
          value is a :class:`pd.Series` whose indices are the assets.

        - If a list of assets and a list of fields are requested, the returned
          value is a :class:`pd.DataFrame`.  The columns of the returned frame
          will be the requested fields, and the index of the frame will be the
          requested assets.

        The values produced for ``fields`` are as follows:

        - Requesting "price" produces the last known close price for the asset,
          forward-filled from an earlier minute if there is no trade this
          minute. If there is no last known value (either because the asset
          has never traded, or because it has delisted) NaN is returned. If a
          value is found, and we had to cross an adjustment boundary (split,
          dividend, etc) to get it, the value is adjusted to the current
          simulation time before being returned.

        - Requesting "open", "high", "low", or "close" produces the open, high,
          low, or close for the current minute. If no trades occurred this
          minute, ``NaN`` is returned.

        - Requesting "volume" produces the trade volume for the current
          minute. If no trades occurred this minute, 0 is returned.

        - Requesting "last_traded" produces the datetime of the last minute in
          which the asset traded, even if the asset has stopped trading. If
          there is no last known value, ``pd.NaT`` is returned.

        If the current simulation time is not a valid market time for an asset,
        we use the most recent market close instead.

        Examples
        --------
        Get the latest price for AAPL (returns a scalar):

        assets: zipline.assets.Asset or iterable of zipline.assets.Asset
            Asset(s) for which tradability should be determined.

        Notes
        -----
        The second condition above warrants some further explanation:

        - If the asset's exchange calendar is identical to the simulation
          calendar, then this condition always returns True.
        - If there are market minutes in the simulation calendar outside of
          this asset's exchange's trading hours (for example, if the simulation
          is running on the CMES calendar but the asset is MSFT, which trades
          on the NYSE), during those minutes, this condition will return False
          (for example, 3:15 am Eastern on a weekday, during which the CMES is
          open but the NYSE is closed).

        The return type of this function depends on the types of ``assets`` and

          :class:`pd.DatetimeIndex`, and its columns will be ``fields``.

        - If multiple assets and a single field are requested, the returned
          value is a :class:`pd.DataFrame` with shape
          ``(bar_count, len(assets))``. The frame's index will be a
          :class:`pd.DatetimeIndex`, and its columns will be ``assets``.

        - If multiple assets and multiple fields are requested, the returned
          value is a :class:`pd.DataFrame` with shape
          ``(len(fields) * bar_count, len(assets))``. The frame's index will
