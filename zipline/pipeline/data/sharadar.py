    DataSetFamily representing Sharadar fundamentals. In order to use
    the data in a pipeline, it must first be sliced to generate a regular
    pipeline DataSet.

    Fundamentals can be sliced along two dimensions:

    - `dimension` : the choices are ARQ, ARY, ART, MRQ, MRY, MRT, where
      AR=As Reported, MR=Most Recent Reported, Q=Quarterly, Y=Annual, and
      T=Trailing Twelve Month.

    - `period_offset` : which fiscal period to return data for. If period_offset
      is 0 (the default), returns the most recent point-in-time fundamentals.
      If period_offset is -1, returns fundamentals for the prior fiscal period;
      if -2, two fiscal periods ago, etc. For quarterly and trailing-twelve-month
      dimensions, previous period means previous quarter, while for annual dimensions,
      previous period means previous year. Value should be a negative integer or 0.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ACCOCI : float
        Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income - [Balance Sheet] A component
        of [Equity] representing the accumulated change in equity from

        translation items; certain pension adjustments; unrealized gains and
        losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities.

    ASSETS : float
        Total Assets - [Balance Sheet] Sum of the carrying amounts as of the
        balance sheet date of all assets that are recognized. Major components
        are [CashnEq]; [Investments];[Intangibles]; [PPNENet];[TaxAssets] and
        [Receivables].

        segments current and non-current assets.

    ASSETSNC : float
        Assets Non-Current - [Balance Sheet] Amount of non-current assets; for
        companies that operate a classified balance sheet. Calculated as the

    CALENDARDATE : datetime64D
        Calendar Date - [Entity] The Calendar Date represents the normalized
        [ReportPeriod]. This provides a common date to query for which is
        necessary due to irregularity in report periods across companies. For
        example; if the report period is "2015-09-26"; the calendar date will be
        "2015-09-30" for quarterly and trailing-twelve-month dimensions
        (ARQ;MRQ;ART;MRT); and "2015-12-31" for annual dimensions (ARY;MRY).
        We also employ offsets in order to maximise comparability of the period
        across companies. For example consider two companies: one with a quarter
        ending on 2018-07-24; and the other with a quarter ending on 2018-06-28.
        A naive normalization process would assign these to differing calendar
        quarters of 2018-09-30 and 2018-06-30 respectively. However, we assign
        these both to the 2018-06-30 calendar quarter because this maximises the
        overlap in the report periods in question and therefore the comparability
        of this period.
